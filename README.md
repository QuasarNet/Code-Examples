### About
Code examples is a simple GitHub repo that houses snippets of code that are free to use. These snippets can be used by Learners and first time Developers for Their personal or public projects. Even for those who are stuck on something, can use anything in this repo to help Them or maybe improve something. As there's going to be quite a lot of snippets, the repo will take time to be fully complete.

### What Can Be Used
Literally anything! Everything is free to use and no credit is required. The whole point of this repo is to help with learning and experimenting!
